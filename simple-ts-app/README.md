# Owl Simple Typescript Application Template

NOTE: this template is not really in a perfect polished state... This is more
like a draft version.

This is a very basic skeleton to start an Owl application. This includes:

- _owl_ (until it is available on `npm`),
- a dev server,
- webpack configuration
- live reload
- typescript integration

## Getting started

1. copy this template wherever you need it
2. edit the `package.json` file with proper name, author, description, ...
3. `npm install` to install every dependency needed

Then you can run the `build` or `dev` scripts...

## Scripts

| Command         | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build` | build the application (in `dist/` folder) |
| `npm run dev`   | starts a dev server                       |
